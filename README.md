# kindle home automation

This repo is related to [a project on 
hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/7126-kindle-as-a-home-automation-controllersensor) which aims is to guess what is 
happening on the Kindle and to react with predefined scenario.

## Past
At the beginning the project was to prove Kindle *could* be a controller for your home automation. You open an ebook, and 
your home automation reacts. This is basically what happenens on the video of the project.

## Now
Now it is possible to integrate your kindle on the pool of sensors of your home automation.
- It's past 11pm, you've read at least 10 pages and screensaver is about to be displayed ? You are asleep, home automation 
turns off the bedside lamp.
- Battery is under 12% ? your kindle sends an alert about that !
- Not opened a book since at least 72h ? â€¦ yes an alert :-)
